\usage{
build_meta(
  data,
  expand_binary_catgs = FALSE,
  add_perc_to_cats = TRUE,
  max_catgs = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame with any combination of the following
attributes: \code{label}, \code{unit}, \code{group}, \code{abbrs}, and \code{notes}.
Columns in the meta data are based on these attributes.}

\item{expand_binary_catgs}{T/F, should all categories be included for
binary categorical variables? (This only applies to binary variables.)}

\item{add_perc_to_cats}{T/F, should categorical variables in
Table 1 have a \% sign following their label? Note that if
the user specifies \code{include_freq} = \code{TRUE} in \link{tibble_one},
then the \% symbol may be confusing to readers. However,
when \code{include_freq} = \code{FALSE}, setting this to \code{TRUE}
should clarify the table.}

\item{max_catgs}{largest number of categories accepted in a factor
variable. A warning message is printed if a factor variable
has more categories than \code{max_catg}.}
}
\value{
A list containing components of \code{data}, \code{group_levels},
and \code{var_levels}. The \code{data} component comprises 8 columns:
\itemize{
\item variable: variable name - this is the column name of the variable.
\item label: variable labels - this is presented in tables
\item type: type of variable (numeric or factor)
\item unit: units for continuous variables
\item group: a group identifier for each variable
\item abbr: abbreviations associated with the label of a variable
\item note: strings that will be place in tables as a footnote
\item labels: labels of variables, including categories of factors.
}

\code{data} is also a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}.

The \code{group_levels} component shows the order that groups will
appear in the table, and \code{var_levels} shows the order that
variables will appear in the table and within groups.

\description{
creates a dataset that describes the
characteristics of another dataset
