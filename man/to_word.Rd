\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{lifecycle::badge("stable")}

Tabular summaries of characteristics (i.e., table one) are generally
presented in a table with columns that describe the overall sample
and subsets of the sample designated by a grouping variable.
In addition, it is expected that variable labels and units will be
indicated, and footnotes will be placed at the bottom of the table
with full descriptions of variables and abbreviations that appear
in the table. This function automates these tasks.
